Write two differences between ArrayList and LinkedList.

Ans: ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store the elements while LinkedList internally uses a doubly linked list to store 
the elements. Moreover, for ArrayList, since it uses array to operate, thus it has to shift all bits in the meomery. LinkedList will
manipulate faster since it uses a doubly linked list, so no bit shifting is required in memory.
